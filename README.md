# AIGS Church Bulletin

This is a project to provide free Adobe InDesign templates, based on the Adventist Identity Guideline System (AIGS), that churches can use for their weekly bulletins.

Current features:
- Template in U.S. legal size (8.5 inches x 14 inches), designed for folding in thirds (trifold).
- Based on InDesign paragraph styles, for easy text updates.
- Standard AIGS logos included.
- Standard ALPS colors (recommended by AIGS documentation) included.
- Uses Noto Sans and Noto Serif, which are the basis of the Advent Sans font (also included).

Roadmap:
- Fold lines, and maybe other template hints, in preview mode.
- Templates in other sizes, including letter and international A sizes.
- Modular items for different types of content.
